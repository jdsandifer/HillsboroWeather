# HillsboroWeather

A weather app that uses the Dark Sky API for reporting current conditions at the airport in Hillsboro, OR.

I'm interested in becomming a helicopter pilot one day and this app would be useful during my training as I would
be taking off and landing regurlarly from that airport.

Check it out on the Google Play store: [Hillsboro Weather App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jdsandifer.hillsboroweather)
